# About me

I am a landscape ecologist currently working as a Research Associate (Postdoc) at the [Ecological Remote Sensing and Modeling Lab](https://www.ersamlab.com/) at Michigan State University. I earned my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Oregon in 2022.
My research focuses on understanding how forests and historically marginalized human populations are affected by and respond to global change. I'm particularly interested in understanding the role of land use and management in shaping ecosystems as well as the interactions between land-use/land-cover change and climate change.</b> 
I've done most of my work in tropical mountains, although I'm currently exploring temperate forests of North America. 
I use an interdisciplinary approach to assess the environmental and social outcomes of global change in forest landscapes. I draw on theories from discplinies such as landscape ecology, global change biology, land system science, political ecology, and environmental justice, and use different quantitative and qualitative methods including geospatial and big data analysis, ecological modeling, and interviews.
