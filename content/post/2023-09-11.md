After meeting over zoom for months, we finally met in person for the intensive week of the [Spectral Ecology Summer School]( https://www.specschool.org) 2023 at the beautiful [Mountain Lake Biological Station](https://mlbs.virginia.edu).
Our time there was split into lab sessions, hands-on coding activities, final project time, inclusive leadership activities, and when rain permitted, some field sessions. We also spent a good amount of time getting to know each other while we worked on our craft projects and hiking.
Iâ€™m more than happy to be part of this project and looking forward to meeting the next cohort! Stay tuned for updates on SPEC School 2024, applications will open soon!
