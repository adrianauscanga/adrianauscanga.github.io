I've been slow to share news here and a lot has happened this past year, but the big one is that I joined the Department of Forest Resources at the University of Minnesota as assistant professor this Fall 2024.
I'm really excited for this new stage in my career. There are many exciting projects coming in the next few months and a new website is under construction so stay tuned!
