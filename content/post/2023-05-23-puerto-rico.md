I'm colaborating with a group from the University of Michigan on a project about coffee farms diversity, aboveground biomass, food justice, and resiliency to climate change.
This month we went on a fieldtrip to the central mountains of Puerto Rico to measure some trees and talk to coffee producers. 
We had a wonderful time! Here are some pictures of the trip.
