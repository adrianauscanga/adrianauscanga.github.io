# About me

I am a landscape ecologist currently working as a Research Associate (Postdoc) at the [Ecological Remote Sensing and Modeling Lab](https://www.ersamlab.com/) at Michigan State University. I earned my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Oregon in 2022.
My research focuses on understanding how forests and historically marginalized human populations are affected by and respond to global change. I'm particularly interested in understanding the role of land use and management in shaping forests structure, diversity, and composition, as well as the interactions between land-use/land-cover change and climate change in tropical mountains.
