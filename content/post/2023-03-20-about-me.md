## About Me
---

I am a landscape ecologist currently working as a Research Associate at the [Ecological Remote Sensing and Modeling Lab](https://www.ersamlab.com/) at Michigan State University. I earned my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Oregon in 2022.
My research focuses on understanding how forests and historically marginalized human populations are affected by and respond to global change.
