#### Disturbance syndromes

Can disturbance syndromes help better predict forest structure and function?
In this project we are characterizing and classifying forest disturbance history using Landsat time series and non-hierarchical classification methods.
For doing so, we are analyzing spectral trajectories of forests with LandTrendr in Google Earth Engine and classifying the disturbance trajectories into *disturbance syndromes*. The main objective of this project is to better understand the role of recent disturbance in shaping current forest structure and function.
See our preliminary results in this [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3H0YCEaDTQwlk9luDaVigq9Dlnmmbg5/view?usp=sharing) focused on the NEON site Harvard Forest that I presented at the [Anthromes, CO2 , and Terrestrial Carbon](https://www.anthromes-co2-and-terrestrial-carbon.com/2023/en/page/home) meeting.

#### Forest structure along environmental and land-use intensity gradients

What are the relative roles of environmental and land-use variables in shaping forest structure?
This project focuses on understanding the spatial distribution of forest structural attributes and aboveground biomass along an elevation gradient and a land-use intensity gradient in tropical mountains. I addressed this question studying forest-agriculture mosaics in the Northern Mountains of Oaxaca, in Mexico, where I took the photo I'm showing below. A paper showing the results of this research is about to be published in the journal Ecosystems.
